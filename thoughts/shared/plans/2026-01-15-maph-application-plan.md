# MAPH Application Plan

**Program:** UChicago Master of Arts Program in the Humanities
**Focus:** Market structure & philosophy of language (Brandom) in the age of AI
**Track:** Part-time (3 courses/quarter, up to 5 years)

---

## Key Takeaways from Admissions Conversation

### Program Structure (Part-Time)
- 3 courses/quarter, up to 5 years flexibility
- Advisory model: faculty liaison for individualized research
- No stipend/funding available
- Goal: embed in research network + develop academic writing

### What They're Evaluating

| Priority | Component | What They Want |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **1** | Statement of Purpose | Articulation of research question, intellectual journey, specific faculty fit |
| **2** | Writing Sample | Academic voice, analytical rigor (10-15 pages) |
| **3** | Letters of Rec | Faculty preferred over supervisors; should speak to academic potential + commitment |

---

## Statement of Purpose: Structure

**Length:** 1-2 pages

**Required Elements:**

1. **Research question** — not just "semantic gaps in markets" but the *philosophical* question: How do inferential structures constitute economic meaning? How does AI reshape the normative vocabulary of exchange?

2. **Intellectual genealogy** — How did you arrive at this question? (software engineering → observed tech debt as language failure → read Brandom → realized this is philosophy of language applied to markets)

3. **Other frameworks you want to engage** — Show you know there's more to learn:
   - Brandom's inferentialism (meaning as inferential role)
   - Habermas on communicative action and validity claims
   - Speech act theory (Austin, Searle) — promises as performatives
   - Philosophy of economics (what constitutes a "market"?)
   - Maybe: Wittgenstein on rule-following (how do norms get established?)

4. **Why MAPH specifically** — The advisory model, interdisciplinary access, foundations in interpretive theory

5. **Faculty fit (1-2 names)** — Do research. Look for:
   - Philosophy of language
   - Ethics (normative frameworks)
   - Anyone working on AI/technology and meaning
   - Social philosophy / critical theory

## Writing Sample: Options

**Length:** 10-15 pages, academic voice

### Option A: Expand "On Tech Debt and Market Failure"
- Currently too short and applied
- Would need to add: theoretical framing, engagement with Brandom, more rigorous argumentation
- Risk: might read as business writing, not philosophy

### Option B: Write Fresh — "Inferential Monopoly and the Philosophy of Economic Language"
- Directly philosophical
- Structure:
  1. Introduction: The problem of meaning in markets
  2. Brandom's inferentialism (brief exposition)
  3. What is "inferential monopoly"? (your contribution)
  4. Case studies as illustrations (Uber, QUBT) — but subordinate to argument
  5. Implications for philosophy of economics
  6. Conclusion: Why this matters for AI

### Option C: Adapt Existing Longer Essay
- `/Users/jinhongkuan/writing/rationalistic-arrogance-economics.md`
- Could be revised with more explicit engagement with philosophy of language literature

**Recommendation:** Option B gives the cleanest signal of philosophical capability.

---

## Letters of Recommendation

**Priority:** Faculty > Professional supervisors

**What to tell recommenders (don't script, but guide):**
- Speak to your **academic interests** and intellectual seriousness
- Speak to your **commitment** to sustained scholarly work
- If professional recommender: emphasize the analytical/theoretical aspects of your work, not just execution

**Possible recommenders:**
- Any faculty you've worked with (even informally)?
- A supervisor who's seen you engage with ideas, not just ship code?
- Someone from a reading group, writing workshop, etc.?

---

## Research To Do Before Applying

### Faculty to Investigate
Look at UChicago Philosophy + affiliated departments for:
- Philosophy of language scholars
- Anyone citing Brandom, Sellars, or Pittsburgh school
- Ethics/normativity people who engage with social structures
- Check recent dissertations from MAPH students with similar interests

### Frames to Name-Drop Intelligently in SoP

| Thinker | Relevant Concept | Your Connection |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Brandom | Inferentialism, space of reasons | Core framework |
| Sellars | "Myth of the Given" | Against naive empiricism in market analysis |
| Habermas | Communicative rationality, validity claims | Markets as distorted communication |
| Austin/Searle | Speech acts, performatives | Promises, contracts as performatives |
| Shiller | Narrative economics | Empirical validation of your thesis |
| Wittgenstein | Rule-following, language games | How market norms get established |

---

## Timeline

| When | Task |
|------|------|
| Now | Research faculty, identify 1-2 names |
| Next 2 weeks | Draft SoP outline, get feedback |
| Month 1-2 | Write fresh writing sample (Option B) |
| Month 2-3 | Revise writing sample, finalize SoP |
| Ongoing | Line up recommenders, give them context |

## Self-Introduction (for future conversations)

> "I'm a software engineer with four years in NYC tech startups, but my real interest is in the philosophy of economic language. I've been developing a thesis I call 'inferential monopoly'—how platforms and companies control meaning by controlling the vocabulary through which economic commitments are understood.
>
> For example, when Uber defines what 'available' means for drivers, or when a quantum computing startup claims 'partnership' for a $26K contract, they're not just marketing—they're exercising normative control over the inferential structure of economic discourse.
>
> I came to this through Robert Brandom's inferentialism. His insight that meaning is constituted by inferential roles, not reference, has direct implications for understanding market failures. I want to formalize this connection: how do AI systems and platforms reshape the 'space of reasons' in economic life?"

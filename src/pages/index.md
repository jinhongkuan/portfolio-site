Field notes from the intersection where business decisions become engineering constraints.

I watch how "simple" features cascade into architectural rewrites. How metrics stop measuring and start controlling. How the gap between intention and implementation reveals something fundamental about modern economic systems.

Traditional economics assumes we observe constraints and then optimize. But what I see daily is different: our decisions create the constraints others must navigate. Each commit in a codebase, each metric on a dashboard, each feature in production — these don't describe reality, they become commitments that reshape what's possible downstream.

### What You'll Find Here

Raw observations. Concrete traces. Patterns that repeat.

Each note captures a moment where something interesting happened — usually when reality refused to match the model. A startup discovers their users want the opposite of what research predicted. A simple feature cascades into architectural rewrites. A metric starts shaping behavior instead of measuring it.

# When Consumer Choice Constrains Economic Freedom

*2025-01-04* · Tags: `economic` `technological` · 🔬 fieldwork

Watch what happens when Uber enters a market:

Day 1: Consumers celebrate — finally, an alternative to unreliable taxis.
Year 1: Drivers join eagerly — flexible income, be your own boss.
Year 3: Original taxi drivers are broke. New drivers discover they're not bosses but algorithmic subjects.

The pattern reveals something economics textbooks miss. Markets aren't spaces where rational actors meet to exchange — they're systems of inferential commitment. When you accept Uber's terms as a driver, you're not just agreeing to a contract. You're entering a web of algorithmic inferences that will determine when you work, where you drive, what you earn.

Jefferson imagined technology empowering independent producers. Instead, we get platforms that transform yesterday's yeoman farmers into today's gig workers. You are simultaneously consumer and producer — liberated in one role, captured in another.

**Evidence:**
- Platform intermediation in transportation: Uber's dual role as liberator (for consumers) and controller (for drivers)
- Displacement pattern: Existing taxi drivers forced to adapt to algorithmic competition or perish
- Jefferson's yeoman farmer vision inverted: Instead of technology empowering independent producers, it creates networks of dependency

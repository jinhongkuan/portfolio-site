# Inference Replaces Representation in Economic Coordination

*2025-01-02* · Tags: `economic` `ontological` · 🪑 armchair

A credit score claims to predict default risk.

Watch what actually happens:
- Score below 600? No loan at prime rates.
- Forced into subprime? Higher payments.
- Higher payments? More likely to default.

The model creates what it claims to measure.

Mainstream economics would call this a market failure or feedback loop. But Brandom helps us see it differently: the credit score isn't representing some pre-existing property called "creditworthiness." It's establishing what creditworthiness means through chains of material inference. Your score doesn't describe your risk — it commits you to a particular position in a web of financial obligations.

This pattern is everywhere. Growth metrics don't measure success, they define it. Engagement algorithms don't discover preferences, they construct them. The map doesn't describe the territory. In modern economic systems, the map inferentially restructures the territory to match itself.

*Armchair reflection while reading Brandom. Needs empirical grounding through startup fieldwork — watch for examples where models reshape rather than describe.*

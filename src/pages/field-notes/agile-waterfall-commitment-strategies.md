# Agile vs Waterfall: Two Commitment Management Strategies

Reading the Agile Manifesto alongside Royce's 1970 paper through Brandom's lens. They're not competing development methodologies—they're different deontic scorekeeping systems.

**Waterfall**: Front-load all commitments. Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing. Each phase *completes* before the next begins. This creates a commitment cascade where early decisions bind all future ones. Perfect for stable environments where commitments can be fully specified upfront (ironically, not what Royce advocated).

**Agile**: Defer commitment specificity. "Responding to change over following a plan." Short iterations allow renegotiation of commitments every 2-4 weeks. This isn't lack of discipline—it's acknowledgment that business commitments themselves evolve.

The key insight: these aren't just project management styles. They're responses to different commitment environments:

- **Use Waterfall when**: Business commitments are stable, regulatory requirements are fixed, the cost of changing commitments is prohibitive
- **Use Agile when**: Market conditions shift rapidly, customer needs are discovered through use, commitment revision is cheaper than commitment failure

Both are rational responses to their contexts. Waterfall assumes commitments can be inferentially complete upfront. Agile assumes the inferential consequences of commitments can only be discovered through enactment.

The real pathology isn't using the "wrong" methodology—it's mismatching commitment strategy to commitment environment. Trying to be Agile with fixed regulatory requirements, or Waterfall in a startup finding product-market fit.

*Note: Royce actually warned against pure sequential waterfall, advocating iteration. The rigid "waterfall" is a misreading of his work—itself a fascinating case of how methodologies become commitments that outlive their rationale.*

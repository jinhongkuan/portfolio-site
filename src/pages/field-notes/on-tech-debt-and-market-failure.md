# On Tech Debt and Market Failure


> "A problem well put is half-solved."
> — John Dewey

The problem-solving aspect of software engineering has always been the most exciting part for me. How can a series of function calls be pieced together to solve a business problem? To me, the reward is in the challenge itself: bridging two different worlds, that of the formulaic software codes and the open-ended realm of commerce.

Having immersed myself in the NYC tech startup scene over the past four years, I saw how Jefferson's optimistic vision of technology empowering the yeoman farmers to earn their own living matured into the digital age. I witnessed first-hand the means through which mission-driven founders leveraged new technologies to disrupt finance and healthcare and broaden access to essential services.

Among successful examples, one pattern emerges in how they incorporate technology: they used it as a tool for mediation--- between stakeholders, competing incentives and functional roles.

Yet one persistent issue often frustrates such initiatives. I call it the _semantic gap_: the loss of resolution in how "core functionalities" and "value proposition" are communicated all the way from customers to engineers.

It exists between [product and engineering teams](/portfolio-site/field-notes/why-tech-debt-is-language-failure), as web3 startups building on the promise for users to "take control of their funds" quietly adopt a trusted-custody model due to unforeseen engineering constraint.

It exists between [the market and the tech sector](/portfolio-site/field-notes/does-technology-create-freer-society) at large, as Uber drivers who sign up "to be their own boss" find their livelihood determined by a black-box algorithm.

I speculate that these two seemingly distinct alignment issues, the micro-level disconnect between the product that was promised versus the product that _gets built_, and the macro-level coordination failure between the market pain points that were communicated and the ones that _get solved_, are in fact deeply intertwined. 

The lack of visibility between marketing and technical expertise within startups results in premature commitments to feature roadmaps, frequent refactors, suboptimal hires and ultimately product pivots. 

On an ecosystem level, this constrains the range of problems being solved. For instance, 61% of B2B SaaS spending comes from large enterprises, even though SMBs represent 99.9% of all US businesses, highlighting the propensity of startups to focus on relatively structured problems rather than tackling ill-defined industry problems that require product and engineering working in close quarters.

This situation will only worsen over time as cutting-edge technology becomes increasingly arcane and innovation requires specialty knowledge in both technology and industry. Closing this semantic and contextual gap is therefore crucial in redirecting tech entrepreneurship towards solving hard but profitable industry problems.

With my private consultation work, I help startups stay on track with their product vision and prevent costly rework by assisting in technical design discussions and managing parallel development tracks. With my writings, I explore the rich literature at the intersection of tech, economics and sociology, applying my own field notes as case studies.

These reflections culminate in my projects, [Bicameral](/portfolio-site/projects), a series of open-source and freemium solutions that leverage large-language models to promote context-sharing in the tech startup space, from contractors, engineers to product and business owners.

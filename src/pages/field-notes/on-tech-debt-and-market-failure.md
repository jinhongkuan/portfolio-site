# On Tech Debt and Market Failure


> "A problem well put is half-solved."
> — John Dewey

The problem-solving aspect of software engineering has always been the most exciting part for me. How can a series of function calls be pieced together to solve a business problem? To me, the reward is in the challenge itself: bridging two different worlds, that of the formulaic software codes and the open-ended realm of commerce.

Having immersed myself in the NYC tech startup scene over the past four years, I saw how Jefferson's optimistic vision of technology empowering the yeoman farmers to earn their own living matured into the digital age. I witnessed first-hand the means through which mission-driven founders leveraged new technologies to disrupt finance and healthcare and broaden access to essential services.

Among successful examples, one pattern emerges in how they incorporate technology: they used it as a tool for mediation--- between stakeholders, competing incentives and functional roles.

Yet one persistent issue often frustrates such initiatives. I call it the _semantic gap_: the loss of resolution in how "core functionalities" and "value proposition" are communicated all the way from customers to engineers.

It exists between [product and engineering teams](/portfolio-site/field-notes/why-tech-debt-is-language-failure), as web3 startups building on the promise for users to "take control of their funds" quietly adopt a trusted-custody model due to unforeseen engineering constraint.

It exists between [the market and the tech sector](/portfolio-site/field-notes/does-technology-create-freer-society) at large, as Uber drivers who sign up "to be their own boss" find their livelihood determined by a black-box algorithm.

I speculate that these two seemingly distinct alignment issues, the micro-level disconnect between the product that was promised versus the product that _gets built_, and the macro-level coordination failure between the market pain points that were communicated and the ones that _get solved_, are in fact deeply intertwined. 

The lack of visibility between marketing and technical expertise within startups results in premature commitments to feature roadmaps, frequent refactors, suboptimal hires and ultimately product pivots. It's a game of Chinese Whispers between the felt pain on the ground and the funding that gets allocated; ultimately, buzzwords become the Schelling point, leading to both oversaturated and underserved markets. 

It is for this reason that we have five meditation apps for every healthcare startup, five food delivery apps for every supply chain startup. Amidst such lopsided competition, the abuse of jargons and buzzwords becomes not just incidental, but also _strategic_ in a bid to distinguish oneself from competitors, further worsening the market failure.   

On an ecosystem level, this constrains the range of problems being solved. For instance, 61% of B2B SaaS spending comes from large enterprises, even though SMBs represent 99.9% of all US businesses, highlighting the propensity of startups to focus on relatively structured problems rather than tackling ill-defined industry problems that require product and engineering working in close quarters. 

This situation will only worsen over time as cutting-edge technology becomes increasingly arcane and innovation requires specialty knowledge in both technology and industry. Closing this semantic and contextual gap is therefore essential in redirecting tech entrepreneurship towards solving hard but profitable industry problems.

To tackle this problem, we have to go one level of abstraction higher--- not just the application of technology to solve business problems, but the means through which technology is created and applied. In this realm, we are forced to confront with the beautiful mess that is human communication, and study how the conclusions of a VC investment thesis, the angry customer phone calls, and the feature negotations that happen over engineering standup calls ultimately coalesce into a piece of software. Luckily for us, we have a tailor-built technology for this purpose: large-language models. This breakthrough, which so far has only found defensible product-market fit as virtual assistant or in isolated domains such as document processing or code generation, holds the potential to bridge man and machine like never before. 

In _Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital_, the author pointed out that every few decades a technological revolution emerges that not only introduces new technologies like electricity and the automobile, but fundamentally changes market structure. I contend that the killer use-case of LLMs is not so much in automating tasks or generating code, although they certainly help increase productivity, but in bridging the semantic gap between market discovery and technological innovation, a paradigm shift that will fundamentally reshape tech entrepreneurship. 

In other words, LLMs hold the potential to transform technology from a black box guarded by the priesthood of engineers into something that organically emerges through repeated interactions between stakeholders: customers, business owners, investors. 

This is a strong claim, but there are already developments that point in this direction: [Context Graphs](https://x.com/akoratana/status/2005303231660867619) that capture organizational context—the _why_ behind engineering decisions—with the direct use-case of turning bug reports into code commits; and [Antikythera Mechanisms](https://x.com/SeanZCai/status/2012580977760260600) that translate business KPIs into model-training evals. 

With my writings, I explore the rich literature at the intersection of tech, economics and sociology, applying my own field notes as case studies. These reflections culminate in my projects, [Bicameral](/portfolio-site/projects), a series of open-source and freemium solutions that leverage large-language models to promote context-sharing in tech teams, from contractors, engineers to business owners and independent dev shops. 

The exciting is the restoration of technology from fueling an economy of obfuscation into one geared around genuine market discovery and pain alleviation. And boy, are there many problems to be solved in the modern economy.

# When Metrics Become the Territory

*2025-01-05* · Tags: `economic` `technological` · 🔬 fieldwork

A social platform optimizes for "engagement." Six months later, every product decision asks: "Will this increase time-on-site?"

Watch the transformation:
- Content algorithms favor outrage (high engagement)
- UI adds friction to leaving (exit points removed)
- Features that create value off-platform get killed
- Team starts believing engagement equals user satisfaction

The metric was supposed to measure value. Instead, it redefined what value means.

This isn't Goodhart's Law exactly. Goodhart assumes a good measure becomes bad when targeted. But engagement was never measuring satisfaction — it was creating its own reality. Once you commit to optimizing engagement, you're in a different game entirely.

Brandom would recognize this: the metric doesn't represent user behavior, it enters into the practice of product development as an inferential commitment. Every feature decision must now be justified in engagement terms. The vocabulary shapes the possibility space.

**Evidence:**
- Startup X: Optimized "active users," killed features users loved but used rarely
- Platform Y: "Watch time" metric led to 3x longer videos, 50% drop in satisfaction
- [Bicameral trace DEC-445]: "North star = engagement" → UI dark patterns within 3 months

*Field note from advising a content platform through metric crisis. The hardest part wasn't changing the metric — it was unwinding all the decisions premised on the old one.*

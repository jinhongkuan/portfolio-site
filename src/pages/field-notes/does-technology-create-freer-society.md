# Does Technology Create a Freer Society?

While FTX was a particularly egregious example of a company optimizing for growth over fidelity, the more pernicious is the _unintentional_ of the contract between consenting parties. The increasing reliance on ill-defined metrics and terminologies (e.g. "creditworthiness", "service rating") to justify the assortment of users on platforms gives these platforms undue leverage over the lives of their users. In the words of Schrepel,

Semantic capture due to context obfuscation, rendering free market unsuitable for economic freedom.

The Uber example is not unique, and the fact that the company controls the very language of the exchange signals the emergence of a new form of economic soft power that has normative implications where the definition of each term favors the platform, displacing previously ad-hoc mutual understanding between human beings. A "surge cost" may have implied a mutual agreement to shift the burden of extra gas between a taxi driver and his passenger during heavy traffic, open for negotiation, but becomes a license for opaque rent-seeking behaviors in the context of a platform:

1. its drivers gave explicit consent to these pricing mechanisms without the possibility of understanding the intricacies of the algorithm that they are now staking their income source on, and
2. even if they did, they would have no meaningful recourse, since the overwhelmingly pro-consumer , an arrangement that simply .. to adopt platform terminology to remain competitive, as in the case of "ride-hailing service".

While platform economics becomes a , the distinction between consumers and laborers become increasingly blurred. One may bene --- is consumer choice actually a good proxy for economic freedom in the information age?

_systems should preserve agency; incentives shouldn't hide behind ambiguity_

an economy of obfuscation.

## Toward an Inferentialist Critique

The representationalist framework of economics cannot easily account for the feasibility space engineering that combines black-box algorithms and vague language to manufacture consent. In my essays and field notes, I explore the potential of applying Robert Brandom's inferentialist framework of language, built upon both the analytic and pragmatist traditions to critique these asymmetric semantic arrangements.

The structural and semantic alignment gap between platforms and their participants is widening. Whether it is the pressure to expand market share or the pressure to satisfy investors, the drive to penetrate every vertical of the economy means that this will soon be adding ever greater gulf between consumer choice and economic freedom. Through the intersection of engineering, economics and linguistics, a new critical vocabulary of the information age, I hope to recover Jefferson's vision of technology empowering the little ones.

engineering must be correct, auditable, and aligned with what's promised to users..

# Projects

Product sees "what customers wants"; engineering sees "what machines can do". This gap compounds from team miscommunication into market-wide coordination failures. (see: [On Tech Debt and Market Failure](portfolio-site/field-notes/on-tech-debt-and-market-failure))

The solution: make softwares that humans understand.

## In Progress

### Making It Explicit — Robert Brandom

- [x] Acquired
- [x] Reading
- [ ] Completed

**Why this matters**: Brandom shows that meaning comes from inferential role in practices, not correspondence to reality. This directly challenges economic models that assume we first observe the world, then optimize within it. Instead, our practices of reasoning create the constraints others must navigate.

**Key chapters**:

- Ch. 1: "Toward a Normative Pragmatics" — social practices ground meaning
- Ch. 8: "The Social Route from Reasoning to Representing" — participatory basis of rationality

**What I'm watching for**: How startup "pivots" embody Brandom's insight — they're not discovering market truth but creating new inferential chains that reshape possibility.

## Planned

### The Black Swan — Nassim Taleb

- [ ] Acquired
- [ ] Started
- [ ] Completed

**Why this matters**: Critique of predictive models assuming normal distributions. Connects to negative theology approach — what we cannot model matters more than what we can.

**Target chapters**:

- Ch. 15: "The Bell Curve, That Great Intellectual Fraud"
- Ch. 16: "The Aesthetics of Randomness"

**Potential connections**: Startup pivots as black swans in miniature

### Pragmatism — William James

- [ ] Acquired
- [ ] Started
- [ ] Completed

**Why this matters**: American pragmatist foundation for truth as "what works in practice" rather than correspondence to reality. Essential for incarnational approach to economic thinking.

## Recently Completed

### The Unaccountability Machine — Dan Davies

- [x] Acquired
- [x] Reading
- [x] Completed

**Key insight**: Modern organizations systematically dissolve accountability through metrics and cybernetic management. Davies shows how "data-driven" decisions create accountability sinks where no one is responsible for outcomes.

**Why this matters**: Every startup I work with eventually asks "how did we end up here?" Davies explains the structural answer — accountability disappears into the metrics. This connects directly to how technical debt becomes "no one's fault."

**Emerging connections**:

- Platform economies as ultimate accountability sinks
- Why Bicameral matters — making decision provenance visible
- How "blameless postmortems" can enable blameless architectures

### Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital — Carlota Perez

- [x] Acquired
- [x] Reading
- [x] Completed

**Key insight**: Technology and finance co-evolve through predictable patterns. We're in an "installation period" where financial capital explores possibilities faster than real value can be created.

**Why this matters**: The chaos I observe in startups isn't random — it's the installation period pattern. Financial metrics run ahead of technical reality, creating the exact commitment mismatches I document.

**Emerging connections**:

- Why startups build "solutions looking for problems"
- Technical debt as installation period artifact
- The coming rebalancing in platform economics

## Reading Notes Structure

Each book gets a dedicated file in `/thoughts/shared/reading-list/[Author-Title].md` tracking:

- Reading progress
- Key chapters for current work
- Connections to field observations
- Emerging patterns

This reading list evolves with the fieldwork — books are selected based on what patterns need theoretical grounding, not abstract interest.

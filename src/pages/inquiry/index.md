# Inquiry

Start anywhere. Each layer reveals something different about the same phenomena.

### Where to Look

**Engineering**  
Watch what breaks. Notice what gets deferred. Track the gap between intention and implementation.

**Technological**  
See how platforms create dependencies. Observe metrics becoming targets. Follow algorithms as they shape possibility.

**Economic**  
Trace incentives through systems. Map constraints as they propagate. Find where feasibility gets engineered.

**Ontological**  
Notice what entities emerge. Question what counts as "real." Watch categories dissolve and reform.

**Metaphysical**  
Ask what makes action possible. Consider what remains when models fail. Wonder why anything works at all.

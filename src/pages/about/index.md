# About

Every startup I've worked with discovers the same thing: their models don't match their users.

Not sometimes. Always.

The interesting part isn't the failure — it's what happens next. Teams adapt, pivot, rewrite. They create new metrics that reshape behavior. They build systems that change what users can even want. The map stops describing the territory and starts reshaping it.

This pattern points to something deeper. Standard economic thinking treats rationality as calculating optimal responses to given constraints. But Brandom showed us that rationality is really about tracking commitments and their consequences. When a startup "pivots," they're not discovering pre-existing market truth — they're creating new inferential chains that others must follow.

I document these moments. Call it techno-economic ethnography if you need a label.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of inquiry and practice:

**Inquiry**: Writing about how modern economic and technical systems no longer represent reality, but actively shape the space of possible actions — especially through software, metrics, and organizational decision-making.

**Practice**: Helping early-stage teams clarify what decisions actually mean before they harden into systems. This upstream work reduces rework by surfacing implicit constraints and mapping feasibility early.

## Current Projects

**[Bicameral Pico](/portfolio-site/about/bicameral-pico)**: An open instrumentation layer that makes organizational decision dynamics observable, replayable, and learnable. It functions as a field instrument for ethnographic observation — capturing how decisions propagate through organizations and become embedded in technical systems.

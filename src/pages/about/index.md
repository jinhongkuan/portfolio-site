## Does Technology Still Create Freer Societies?

This question haunts me as I navigate New York's tech scene, drawn here by Jefferson's vision of technology empowering independent producers. Yet what I witness daily is its inversion: platforms that promise freedom while engineering dependency.

Every startup I've worked with discovers the same thing: their models don't match their users. Not sometimes. Always.

The interesting part isn't the failure — it's what happens next. Teams adapt, pivot, rewrite. They create new metrics that reshape behavior. They build systems that change what users can even want. The map stops describing the territory and starts reshaping it.

## The Pragmatist Project

Traditional economics thinks *representationally* — models describe reality, metrics measure behavior, algorithms optimize outcomes. This view has led to modernity's characteristic ills: the tyranny of metrics (Muller), the unaccountability machine (Davies), the black swan blindness (Taleb). Now ML threatens to amplify these tendencies, optimizing away the very spaces where economic freedom exists.

There's another way. The American pragmatist tradition — from Peirce and James through Dewey and Brandom — offers an *inferentialist* alternative. Rather than representing reality, our economic models and technical systems create inferential commitments that reshape possibility. As Brandom argues in "Making It Explicit," rationality emerges not from private utility calculations but from social practices of giving and asking for reasons. When platforms monopolize these practices, they exercise power more profound than traditional market dominance.

Consider Uber's "be your own boss" rhetoric. This isn't describing driving-for-hire but redefining it through what I call "inferential monopoly." The platform doesn't just match riders with drivers — it monopolizes the normative vocabulary through which drivers express economic agency. Drivers cannot negotiate prices, communicate collectively, or make direct claims about service quality. Every meaningful economic decision remains with the platform. Meanwhile, taxi drivers who never chose this system find their feasibility space transformed by venture-capital-subsidized prices they cannot match. The individual "choice" to trade autonomy for platform access creates an autonomy cascade, forcing the same trade-off on everyone.

When we apply inferentialist thinking to technology, we see it's fundamentally about controlling meaning-making. Credit scores exemplify this — they define "creditworthiness" through opaque algorithms while preventing any participation in that definition. As Schrepel and Pentland (2024) show, platforms engineer feasibility spaces that "preserve technical choice while systematically eliminating meaningful exit." Traditional economics can't capture how technical architecture doesn't just process transactions but defines what counts as one.

## My Focus: Engineering Economic Agency

I'm driven by a simple question: How do we build systems that expand rather than constrain human agency?

This pattern points to something deeper. Standard economic thinking treats rationality as calculating optimal responses to given constraints. But Brandom showed us that rationality is really about tracking commitments and their consequences. When a startup "pivots," they're not discovering pre-existing market truth — they're creating new inferential chains that others must follow.

I document these moments where philosophy, economics, and technology meet — call it techno-economic ethnography if you need a label.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of inquiry and practice:

**Inquiry**: Writing about how modern economic and technical systems no longer represent reality, but actively shape the space of possible actions — especially through software, metrics, and organizational decision-making.

**Practice**: Helping early-stage teams clarify what decisions actually mean before they harden into systems. This upstream work reduces rework by surfacing implicit constraints and mapping feasibility early.

## Current Projects

**[Bicameral Pico](/portfolio-site/about/bicameral-pico)**: An open instrumentation layer that makes organizational decision dynamics observable, replayable, and learnable. It functions as a field instrument for ethnographic observation — capturing how decisions propagate through organizations and become embedded in technical systems.

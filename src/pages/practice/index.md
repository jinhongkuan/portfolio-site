# Practice

Your team ships a feature. Three months later, you're rewriting it.

Not because requirements changed. Because the requirements were never what you thought they were.

I work upstream — before code gets written. I help teams discover what they're actually committing to, what constraints they're accepting, what decisions they're making without realizing it.

The evidence is always there. In Slack threads. In offhand comments. In the architecture decisions that "seemed obvious at the time."

## How I Work

### Diagnostic Sprint (2–3 weeks)
I review existing discussions, docs, and code to surface implicit commitments, constraints, and likely rework points.

### Decision Artifacts  
I produce clear briefs and feasibility maps that teams can align on before committing to build paths.

### Optional Ongoing Support
I stay embedded upstream (10–20 hrs/week) to intercept ambiguity early and support execution via contractors if needed.

This work is upstream by design — it reduces work that would otherwise need to be done later.

## What Teams Get

- **Decision Briefs**: What the business is actually committing to, including unstated constraints
- **Engineering Feasibility Maps**: What must exist vs. what can be deferred, where scope typically expands  
- **Rework Risk Analysis**: Likely rework hotspots and long-term maintenance implications
- **Translation Layer**: Clear communication between product, business, and engineering stakeholders

## Background

My experience spans CTO and senior engineering roles in regulated and high-stakes systems across fintech, healthcare, and trading infrastructure. This background informs my ability to spot patterns where decisions drift from their original intent.

Real example: How a "rebuild our notifications" request became a study in organizational commitment patterns — and saved 6 months of engineering effort.

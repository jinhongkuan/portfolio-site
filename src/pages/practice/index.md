# Practice

Consultants advise from a distance. Staff engineers optimize for robustness over speed.

I work directly with your team, shipping code and facilitating design conversations to catch drift between architectural decisions and product goals    before it compounds.                                                            

### Diagnostic Sprint (3 weeks)

- Review your repo, infra, and roadmap.
- Ship alongside the team (familiarity with Rust/Typescript/Java)
- You get: PRD, tech specs with buy-in from your team.
- Clear outline on engineering tasks to prioritize in the next 30-60 days.

### Ongoing Support 

10-20hr/wk contract engagement, keeping engineering tasks aligned with product priorities and ensuring engineering constraints are accounted for. I contribute directly to the codebase when needed, managing in-house contractors but always serving as contact point for the team.

# Practice

For startups building a technical moat, I get into the midst of product and engineering — facilitating design conversations and requirements that keep complex features on track.

Conventional consulting delivers a plan and walks away. Startups need someone in the weeds, a reliable support who understands the working assumptions, ships alongside the team, and stays close enough to catch drift before it compounds. My main objective as a support engineer is therefore to serve as a force multiplier for the team.

## Engagements

### Diagnostic Sprint (3 weeks)

- Review your repo, infra, and roadmap.
- Clarify requirements, sequence the work, get alignment.
- You get: PRD, tech spec, milestone plan, and risk register — with buy-in from your team.
- Clear vision on what to prioritize in the next 30 days.

### Ongoing Support (monthly)

I stay involved in key syncs, create concise docs to keep engineering tasks aligned with product priorities, and ensure engineering constraints are surfaced. When needed, I ship alongside the team, managing in-house contractors but always serving as contact point for the team.

## Background

CTO and senior engineering roles across fintech, healthcare, and high-frequency trading. I've seen where decisions drift from intent — and how to catch it before it becomes a 20-ticket rewrite.

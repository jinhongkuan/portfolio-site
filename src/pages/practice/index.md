# Practice

## How I Work

### Diagnostic Sprint (2–3 weeks)
- Review existing discussions, docs, and code to surface implicit commitments, constraints, and likely rework points
- Work directly with engineers and product owners to identify both feature development roadmap as well as engineering complexities
- Ship code alongside the team to understand the engineering process firsthand

### Decision Artifacts  
I produce clear briefs and feasibility maps to increase overall visibility on the team, and surface potential timeline risks for the team to consider.

### Optional Ongoing Support
I stay embedded upstream (10–20 hrs/week) to intercept ambiguity early and support execution via contractors if needed.

This work is upstream by design — it reduces work that would otherwise need to be done later.

## Background

My experience spans CTO and senior engineering roles in regulated and high-stakes systems across fintech, healthcare, and trading infrastructure. This background informs my ability to spot patterns where decisions drift from their original intent.

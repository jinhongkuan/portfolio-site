Philosophy: Show the work emerging, not the system complete

Field notes are written raw and published quickly. Connections emerge through accumulation, not planning. The structure itself is an argument: understanding happens through concrete observation linked by inference, not abstract systematization.

Inspired by:
- Montaigne's essays as trials of thought
- Vienna.earth's recursive connection interface  
- Ethnographic fieldwork's patience with pattern
- Brandom's inferentialism as method, not just theory

The goal is not to convince but to make visible. See for yourself.

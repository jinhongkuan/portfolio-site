# Inference & Agency

Three startups. Same pattern.

Startup A builds recommendation engine. Engine starts shaping user preferences.
Startup B creates risk scoring. Scores start determining who takes risks.
Startup C launches matching algorithm. Algorithm begins defining what matches are possible.

Each thought they were building mirrors. Each built engines.

Standard economic theory would analyze this as revealed preference or market discovery. But that misses the crucial move: these systems don't reveal pre-existing preferences or discover latent demand. They create new spaces of possibility through material inference. 

When your recommendation engine suggests products, it's not uncovering what users "really want" — it's establishing chains of inference about what wanting means in this context. Each click becomes a commitment that shapes future possibility spaces.

## Bicameral Connection

The Bicameral instrumentation project emerged from observing this pattern repeatedly: decisions don't follow from representations of the world, but from chains of inference that become materially embedded in code, metrics, and organizational memory.

Key traces:
- Decision events showing how "simple" features cascade into complex constraints
- Requirement evolution as inferential chains, not static specifications
- The gap between stated rationale and enacted commitment

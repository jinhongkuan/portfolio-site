# Threads

These collections group observations that seem to point toward deeper, recurring features of the world we're trying to understand. They are not chapters in a book — they are clusters of insight in progress.

## Active Threads

### [Inference & Agency](/portfolio-site/threads/inference-agency)
How modern systems shift from representing the world to actively inferring and shaping what becomes possible

### [Techno-Economic Constraint](/portfolio-site/threads/techno-economic-constraint)  
The ways technology and economics jointly structure the space of feasible action

### [Organizational Memory](/portfolio-site/threads/organizational-memory)
How decisions propagate through systems and become embedded in infrastructure

## Emerging Patterns

- **Engineered Feasibility Spaces**: How platforms and metrics create the conditions for certain kinds of action while foreclosing others
- **Emergent Rationality**: The gap between stated decision logic and enacted organizational behavior
- **The Participatory Turn**: Moving beyond representational models toward systems that acknowledge their role in constituting reality

*Threads emerge from accumulated field notes. They are provisional groupings, open to revision as understanding develops.*

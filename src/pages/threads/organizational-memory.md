# Organizational Memory

A startup's codebase tells two stories. 

The first is what the code does — features, APIs, business logic. The second is what decisions created it — the commitments made in Slack threads, the constraints accepted in planning meetings, the assumptions hardened into architecture.

The second story matters more. But it's usually invisible.

Watch what happens when a senior engineer leaves:
- "Why is this service separate?" Nobody remembers.
- "Why do we store data this way?" Lost to time.
- "Why can't we just change it?" Because every decision creates downstream commitments.

Traditional economics assumes perfect information. Real organizations operate on fragmented memory. The gap between what was decided and what gets remembered shapes everything that follows.

## Bicameral Connection

This is why I built Bicameral — not to make decisions, but to make decision history visible. Every feature request that becomes technical debt started as a reasonable choice. The problem isn't the choice. It's the forgetting.

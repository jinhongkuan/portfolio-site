# Techno-Economic Constraint

Economics textbooks teach constraints as given: budgets, resources, technology. But watch what actually constrains startups:

- The ORM you chose in week 2
- The metric you picked for your dashboard  
- The API contract you exposed to early customers
- The hiring decision that shaped your architecture

These aren't natural limits. They're commitments that crystallized into constraints.

A fintech startup I worked with discovered this viscerally. They modeled risk "conservatively" in their MVP. Six months later, that model was baked into every customer contract, every compliance document, every investor pitch. Changing it would mean unwinding an entire business.

The model wasn't describing their risk tolerance. It was constituting it.

Standard economics treats technology as an exogenous constraint on optimization. But technology and economics co-evolve through chains of commitment. Your technical choices become economic reality. Your economic needs reshape technical possibility.

## The Pattern

Every "technical" decision is economic. Every "business" choice becomes code. The boundary between them is a convenient fiction that obscures how constraints actually emerge — not from nature, but from our own prior commitments solidifying into structure.
